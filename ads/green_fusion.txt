About the job

Digitalization and energy transition in one sentence? That‚Äôs what we do at Green Fusion! Our software optimizes heating systems in the real estate sector, helping to combat climate change through digitalization and automation. We reduce emissions and energy consumption, actively advancing the energy transition.

As a Data Scientist, you‚Äôll support our Energy Optimization Team by developing production-ready algorithms that optimize heating system operations. With a basic understanding of heating systems and strong expertise in control technology, you‚Äôll bring essential insights to help us develop effective tools for energy optimization.

Tasks

    Data Analysis: Clean and analyze data to identify patterns and trends, uncovering insights that drive our solutions.
    Statistical Analysis: Use statistical techniques to interpret data, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of your findings.
    Data Science: Create data models to predict heating system behavior and patterns using advanced analytics techniques and machine learning.
    Algorithm Development: Create production-ready algorithms and data pipelines to optimize energy system components, reducing CO2 emissions and enhancing energy efficiency.
    Collaboration: You will be responsible for the entire process of developing product features, from understanding customer requirements to final feature deployment. This requires seamless collaboration with energy engineers, frontend and backend developers, product and customer success managers.
    Research Support: Conduct experimental data analysis to refine and improve energy optimization algorithms.
    Clear Communication: Present findings in a concise and understandable manner.
    Additional tasks: Support our team in creating data models to predict energy time series data (e.g. heat demand, solar production, electricity consumption) and in optimizing energy systems using machine learning algorithms ((Un)supervised and Reinforcement Learning).

Requirements
