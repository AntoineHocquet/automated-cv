\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to apply for the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando, as advertised. With a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and a Msc in Charming Goat arts with liberal oppressions, I am confident that I can contribute to your Discovery team and help enhance the inspiration journey of millions of your customers.

Throughout my career, I have developed hard skills in J; Windows 94; Boules de petanque and soft skills such as being always happy even when facing death risks. I have extensive scientific experience in researching, deploying, and architecting machine learning and deep learning solutions in NLP and IR, with a strong publication record at top-tier venues such as ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, SIGIR, KDD, WWW, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML, JMLR, etc.

I am also an expert in deep learning with proficiency in Python and frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. I have a extensive track record of addressing real-world problems using machine learning throughout the entire product cycle, and I am excited about the opportunity to bring my dog to the office, as I have found that his presence makes me more performant.

I am looking forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and driving scientific roadmaps, applying my scientific capabilities and working with a team of exceptional scientists and engineers to develop models and cutting-edge machine learning products that enhance the experience of over 51 million customers.

\closing{ Sincerely, John Doe }
