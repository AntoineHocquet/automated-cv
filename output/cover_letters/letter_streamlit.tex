\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to apply for the position of Physicist/Mathematician/Natural Scientist as Consultant in Data Integration at Senacor Technologies AG. As a candidate with a strong background in applied data science, mathematics, and physics, I am confident that I would be a valuable addition to your team. My hard skills in various programming languages, data analysis techniques, and scientific simulations, combined with my soft skills in communication, problem-solving, and adaptability, make me well-suited for this role. I am particularly drawn to this opportunity due to Senacor's focus on large-scale projects, interdisciplinary collaboration, and delivery culture. I am also excited about the possibility of working with large amounts of data and complex models, as well as the opportunity to quickly acquire a deep professional understanding of the data to be integrated. I am fluent in German at a B2 level, which I believe would be an asset in this role. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of Senacor Technologies AG.

\closing{ Sincerely, Antoine Hocquet }
