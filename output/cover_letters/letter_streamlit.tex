\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando, as advertised. As a seasoned professional with a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and a Msc in Charming Goat arts with liberal oppressions, I am confident that my extensive experience in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) will greatly benefit your Discovery team. My background in various programming languages, including J and Windows 94, as well as my soft skills, such as my perpetual optimism, will enable me to contribute significantly to enhancing the inspiration journey of millions of your customers. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to collaborate with exceptional scientists and engineers, drive scientific roadmaps, and apply my expertise in transformer-based deep neural networks and large language models.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the objectives of the Senior Principal Applied Scientist role.

Sincerely,
John Doe
