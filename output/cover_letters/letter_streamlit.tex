\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando. As a seasoned professional with a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and extensive experience in NLP and IR, I am confident that my skills and passion make me a perfect fit for this role. My background includes a diverse set of hard skills, such as proficiency in J, Windows 94, and Boules de petanque, as well as a range of soft skills, including an unwaveringly positive attitude even in the face of death-defying situations. I am fluent in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, and Lord of the Rings.

I am particularly drawn to Zalando's commitment to innovation and dedication to creating cutting-edge machine learning products that enhance the customer experience. I am excited about the opportunity to lead scientific research and drive the strategic roadmap for NLP and IR, while collaborating with a team of exceptional scientists and engineers. I am confident that my extensive track record in deep learning and NLP, as well as my experience in mentoring and knowledge sharing, will enable me to make significant contributions to Zalando's discovery team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your team.

Sincerely,
John Doe
