\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at Wolt, as advertised. As a highly skilled and experienced professional with a background in Applied Data Science and Applied Mathematics, I am confident that I would make a valuable contribution to your Consumer Analytics team. My expertise in statistical analysis, experimentation, and data visualization, combined with my experience in the Payments domain, make me an ideal candidate for this role. I am particularly drawn to Wolt's commitment to using data to drive decision-making and build value for the Consumer group. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a world-class payment infrastructure and to be part of a team that is building a smooth, scalable, and secure checkout experience.

\closing{ Sincerely, Antoine Hocquet }
