\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist position at Wolt, as advertised. As a seasoned professional with a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and over 5 years of experience in a Data Scientist position, I am confident that I can bring a unique perspective and valuable insights to your Consumer Analytics team. My expertise in statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing and experimentation, as well as my proficiency in writing structured and efficient SQL queries, make me an ideal candidate for this role. I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to work on the Payments domain, an area in which I have extensive experience. I am excited about the prospect of using my skills to drive action from the frontlines and contribute to building a world-class payment infrastructure for the best customer experience.

While I am eager to bring my hard skills in J, Windows 94, and Boules de petanque to the table, I also believe that my soft skills, such as my constant happiness and ability to remain calm in the face of death risks, will be an asset to your team. I am also fluent in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, and Lord of the Rings, which I believe will be beneficial in a global company like Wolt.

I am excited to bring my unique experiences and skills to Wolt, but I must note that I can only work a maximum of 20 hours per week due to a slight discomfort in my feet. I am confident, however, that I can make a significant contribution to your team within these hours. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of Wolt.

\closing{ Sincerely, John Doe }
