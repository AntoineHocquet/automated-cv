\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at super.AI, as advertised. As a highly skilled and experienced professional with a PhD in Applied Mathematics and a background in Applied Data Science, I am confident that I can make a significant contribution to your team. My hard skills in Python, R, SQL, C++, and other relevant programming languages and tools, along with my expertise in machine learning, numerical methods, and scientific simulations, align well with the requirements of the role. I am particularly drawn to super.AI's mission to make AI accessible to all and use it to enrich the human experience. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a group of smart, creative people who are dedicated to transforming the way AI is created and consumed.

In my previous experience, I have demonstrated my ability to measure and ensure the high-quality output of AI workloads, deploy and manage production workloads for a global customer base, write, rewrite, and extend Python code, and deploy it to containers. I am familiar with distributed systems and cloud services, and have solid understanding of machine learning principles. I have also worked with container frameworks such as Docker or Kubernetes, and have proficiency in using REST APIs.

As a person, I am smart, humble, hardworking, and collaborative. I am passionate about astrophysics, theoretical physics, and quantum mechanics, and I enjoy observing the night sky with my personal telescope, playing guitar and piano, and cooking. I am fluent in French and English, and have conversational skills in German.

I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to super.AI's mission and work culture, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing my application with you further. Thank you for considering my application.

\closing{ Sincerely, Antoine Hocquet }
