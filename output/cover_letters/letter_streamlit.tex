\opening{ Dear Hiring Manager, }

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at super.AI. With a PhD in Applied Mathematics and a background in Applied Data Science, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your mission of creating AI technology that is accessible to all. My hard skills in Python, R, SQL, C++, and other programming languages, as well as my experience with container frameworks such as Docker and Kubernetes, make me a strong fit for this role. Additionally, my soft skills in science communication, public speaking, and interdisciplinary collaboration would allow me to effectively collaborate with and contribute to your team.

I am particularly drawn to super.AI's focus on using AI to enrich the human experience and make the world a better place. I am excited about the opportunity to work with a group of smart, creative people who are dedicated to this mission. I am available to start immediately and would be thrilled to contribute my skills and experience to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of super.AI.

Sincerely, Antoine Hocquet
