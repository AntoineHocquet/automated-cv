\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando. With a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and a diverse background in various scientific fields, I am confident that I can bring a unique perspective and valuable expertise to your team. My hard skills include proficiency in J, Windows 94, and Boules de petanque, as well as a deep understanding of natural language processing and information retrieval methods. I am particularly skilled in transformer-based deep neural networks and large language models, having developed and deployed such solutions in various real-world projects.

In addition to my technical skills, I am known for my positive attitude and ability to stay calm under pressure, even when facing death risks. I am fluent in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, and Lord of the Rings, and I am an experienced mentor and guide to senior and principal scientists. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Zalando's discovery systems and help drive the scientific roadmap for your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of Zalando's discovery systems and enhance the inspiration journey of millions of your customers.

Sincerely,
John Doe
