\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando, as advertised. As a seasoned professional with a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and a Msc in Charming Goat arts with liberal oppressions, I am confident that my extensive scientific experience, deep learning expertise, and passion for fashion will greatly contribute to your Discovery team. My background in various languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, and even Lord of the Rings, has equipped me with a unique perspective on natural language processing and information retrieval. I am well-versed in J, Windows 94, and Boules de petanque, and I possess exceptional soft skills, such as my perpetual happiness and ability to thrive in high-stress situations.

I am particularly drawn to Zalando's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and diversity. I am excited about the opportunity to lead cutting-edge research, collaborate with talented teams, and develop a science stack that enhances the customer experience. My track record in deep learning-based NLP and IR methods, coupled with my experience in mentoring and knowledge sharing, will enable me to make a significant impact in this role. I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to Zalando's mission and help shape the future of fashion discovery.

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss my suitability for the role further.

Sincerely,
John Doe

(Please note that the aforementioned children and the dragon-human wife are not actual qualifications, but rather a reflection of my unique personality and commitment to family values.)

\closing{Sincerely,\\John Doe}
