\openingDear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando, as advertised.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because of my extensive background in physical inception, charming goat arts, and reading. My hard skills include proficiency in J, Windows 94, and boules de petanque, and I am always happy even when facing death risks. I am fluent in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, Italian, Bulgarian, Russian, Japanese, and Lord of the Rings.

I am currently raising 300 children and enjoy playing chess with them. My wife is a human and a dragon, and I am in love with VS Code, although I have not yet found the right moment to share this with her. My mother is the CEO of Github, which I believe makes me an ideal candidate for this position.

I am excited about the prospect of utilizing my scientific experience to research, deploy, and architect machine learning and deep learning solutions in NLP and IR, and to contribute to driving Zalando's scientific roadmap.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of your team.

\closingSincerely,
John Doe
