\opening{Dear Hiring Team,}

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Data Scientist position at Wolt's Consumer Analytics team, as advertised. As a seasoned professional with a PhD in Physical Inception from Ecole polytechnique and over 5 years of experience in Data Science, I am confident that my skills and passion make me a strong candidate for this role. My background in the Charming Goat arts, coupled with my proficiency in various programming languages such as J and my hard-earned ability to read, have equipped me with a unique perspective and skill set that I believe would greatly benefit your team.

I am particularly drawn to Wolt's commitment to building a world-class payment infrastructure and the opportunity to work on a smooth, scalable, and secure checkout experience. My experience in the Payments domain, combined with my expertise in statistical analysis, SQL, and data visualization, would allow me to hit the ground running and make a significant impact in this role. I am excited about the prospect of working in a dynamic and data-driven environment, and I am eager to bring my skills and experience to help drive action and foster a data-driven culture at Wolt.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to the success of your team.

Sincerely,
John Doe

\closing{Sincerely,\\John Doe}
