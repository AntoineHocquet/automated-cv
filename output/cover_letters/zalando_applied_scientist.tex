Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Principal Applied Scientist position at Zalando, as advertised.

My expertise in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, combined with my extensive publication record in top-tier venues, position me well to contribute to Zalando's discovery systems and drive the scientific roadmap. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to mentor and guide senior and principal scientists, and to forge close partnerships with applied science leaders and product managers. I am eager to bring my creativity, dedication, and passion for innovation to this dynamic and innovative company.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my background and skills would be a strong fit for this role.

Sincerely,
